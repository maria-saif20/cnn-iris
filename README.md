## Introduction

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It consists of 150 samples, each representing one iris flower. There are four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) measured in centimeters. The target variable is the species of iris (setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and model building using various machine learning algorithms on the Iris dataset.
